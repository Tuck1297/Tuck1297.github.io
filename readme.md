## Project Overview

Being my first ever developed website, this project aims to share my abilities at using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a webpage telling you a bit about myself and my history. On this page you will find information pertaining to my Resume, Project history, a bit more about me. Other than the technology already mentioned, this project also utilizes Foundation (a CSS/JavaScript Library) to allow the webpage to be accessed and navigated through from any device. This project is a perfect, but simple example, of developing best practices in terms of web development while also making it accessible for all devices.
