  <h1>Personal Website Project</h1>
</div>

## Project Overview

This project is beginning of my journey in web development. To begin to learn and understand the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript one must understand how they work together to compile a webpage in a browser. Other than understanding the fundamentals, this project focused on creating a personal website that outlined at the time information about oneself. The specific criteria that were decided on include a page outlining accomplished projects, a Resume page, a short bio page and a homepage.

  - Links to other pages on your own site should replace the current window/tab, whereas links to external sites should open in a new window/tab
  - Use scalable font units (e.g. rems)
  - Resize images to the size you will be displaying them (i.e. edit the photo, don't just resize via HTML/CSS) --> this prevents the download of an unnecessarily large image file
