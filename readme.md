Web Development - Homework Assignment 1
---------------------------------------
16 pts: Create the following pages
  Home page (index.html)
      Headshot photo of yourself
      A bit about you (e.g. what you are majoring in, what your goals are after college, etc.)
  Projects (projects.html)
      Minimum of 3 projects that you have worked on in other classes / internships
      Describe the purpose of each project and the work you did
      Include at least one photo for each project
  Resume (resume.html)
      Typical resume stuff... but in HTML!
      Education
      Work Experience
      Honors/Awards
      Include links (e.g. when you list St. Thomas in the Education section, it should link to https://stthomas.eduLinks to an external site.)
  Fun Stuff (fun.html)
      Tell something interesting about yourself (e.g. hobbies, aspirations, your pets, etc.)
      Include media (images, videos, and/or links)
      4 pts: Create a coherent CSS style for all pages
      2 pts: Ensure there is a way to navigate between all 4 pages
      
4 pts: Make your website responsive (ensure it works well on a mobile device in addition to a desktop/laptop)
4 pts: Ensure the following best practices are followed
      Links/images to content on your own site should use relative paths
      Links to other pages on your own site should replace the current window/tab, whereas links to external sites should open in a new window/tab
      Use scalable font units (e.g. rems)
      Resize images to the size you will be displaying them (i.e. edit the photo, don't jest resize via HTML/CSS)
      Prevents downloading an unnecessarily large image file
