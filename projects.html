                <h3>Computer Graphics - Lighting, Shaders, and Texture Mapping</h3>
                <p>
                  Focused on working with <a class="content_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL" target="_blank">WebGL</a>, this
                  assingment had an
                  overall
                  objective to implement the necessary code to accurately simulate real world lighting and textures on
                  3D
                  objects.
                  It is not easily seen on the images here but I focused the majority of my time in
                  implementing
                  the simulation of multiple lights for this project. My partner focused on mapping the textures such as
                  the one that
                  you see on the red cube.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In addition, my partner and I were tasked in adding our own three dimensional shapes. While my partner
                  did the rhombus
                  I worked on the yellow star seen on the right of both images. There were two main light settings that
                  we
                  implemented. The first
                  is called <a class="content_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouraud_shading" target="_blank">gouraud</a>
                  shading while the other is called <a class="content_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_shading"
                    target="_blank">phong</a>
                  shading and they are essentially two of the most common kinds of lighting calculations that
                  one would
                  find being used for online applications.

                <h3>World Cinema Final Essay</h3>
                <p>
                  Throughout the semester in a course called World Cinema I was given the opportunity to watch films
                  made
                  throughout the last
                  few decades in many different countries including France, Japan, and Hong Kong. As a final
                  project for the class, I was
                  allowed to choose a country in which I would watch two films and compare them. I choose the country
                  China because of their
                  emphasis on martial arts films. One was titled <a class="content_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_(2002_film)" target="_blank"><i>Hero</i></a> and the other was titled <a class="content_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crouching_Tiger,_Hidden_Dragon" target="_blank"><i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i></a>. 
                  Throughout the essay I compared how beyond the martial arts these
                  films
                  emphasized different
                  cultural aspects that would have been seen in the time eras in which these films were placed (between
                  1046 BCE to 206 BCE).
                  Overall, my favorite part of this assignment was watching the films and seeing another culture's films
                  that I previously never knew about.

                <h3>Interaction with Graphics - Creative Coding Final Assignment</h3>
                <p>
                  Interaction with Graphics is a multimedia installation that immerses the audience in the virtual realm
                  of computer
                  graphics through auditory, visual, and interactive queues. This time sequenced project, which is
                  entirely written
                  in Javascript with a library called <a class="content_link" href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank">ThreeJS</a>,
                  implements a variety
                  of abstract and
                  structured sequences, all of which demonstrate mathematical and programming achievements made in the
                  last 30 years,
                  such as perlin noise and sophisticated 3-dimensional model rendering. The main objective of this
                  endeavor is to
                  remind its audience of the past while demonstrating what the future holds.

                <h3>Computer Graphics - 3D Projections</h3>
                <p>
                  This project's main focus was to learn how to draw 3D lines onto a
                  view plane using HTML's 2D API. Throughtout this project I was able
                  to successfully implement not only parallel and perspective projections
                  but also other features including animation, moving around
                  the three dimensional shapes by using specific keyboard keys, and generating
                  some common three dimensional shapes like cubes, cylinders and cones. I was extremely
                  close to finishing the sphere as well. The sceen you see above is a custom scene
                  in which I precalculated and uploaded via JSON to the project.
