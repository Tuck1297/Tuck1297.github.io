                Focused on working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL">WebGL</a>, this assingment had an
                overall
                objective to implement the necessary code to accurately simulate real world lighting and textures on 3D
                objects.
                It is not easily seen on the images here but I focused the majority of my time in
                implementing
                the simulation of multiple lights for this project. My partner focused on mapping the textures such as
                the one that
                you see on the red cube.

                In addition, my partner and I were tasked in adding our own three dimensional shapes. While my partner
                did the rhombus
                I worked on the yellow star seen on the right of both images. There were two main light settings that we 
                implemented. The first
                is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouraud_shading">gouraud</a>
                shading (frist image) while the other is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_shading">phong</a>
                shading (second) and they are essentially two of the most common kinds of lighting calculations that one would 
                find being used for online applications.

                Throughout the semester in a course called World Cinema I was given the opportunity to watch films made
                throughout the last
                few decades from and in many different countries including France, Japan, and Hong Kong. As a final
                project for the class, I was
                allowed to choose a country in which I would watch two movies and compare them. I choose the Chinese
                region because of their
                emphasis on martial arts films. Throughout the essay I compared how beyond the martial arts these films
                emphasized different
                cultural aspects that would have been seen in the time eras in which these films were placed (between
                1046 BCE to 206 BCE).
                Overall, my favorite part of this assignment was watching the films and seeing another culture's films
                that I previously never
                knew about.

                  Interacting with Graphics is a multimedia installation that immerses the audience in the virtual realm
                  of computer
                  graphics through auditory, visual, and interactive queues. This time sequenced project, which is
                  entirely written
                  in Javascript with a library called <a href="https://threejs.org/">ThreeJS</a>, implements a variety
                  of abstract and
                  structured sequences, all of which demonstrate mathematical and programming achievements made in the
                  last 30 years,
                  such as perlin noise and sophisticated 3-dimensional model rendering. The main objective of this
                  endeavor is to
                  remind its audience of the past while demonstrating what the future holds.

                This project's main focus was to learn how to draw 3D lines onto a
                view plane using HTML's 2D API. Throughtout this project I was able
                to successfully implement not only parallel and perspective projections
                but also other features including animation, moving around
                the three dimensional shapes by using specific keyboard keys, and generating
                some common three dimensional shapes like cubes, cylinders and cones. I was extremely
                close to finishing the sphere as well. The sceen you see above is a custom scene
                in which I precalculated and uploaded via JSON to the project.
