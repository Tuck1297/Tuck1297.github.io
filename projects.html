                  This project was focused on building a web page that displays crime information released by the 
                  St. Paul Police Department. The main concepts focused on during this assignment where on creating and 
                  implementing a Restful API on the server side and how to make and receive requests to said API on the client 
                  side.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Restful API was created using Node.js and communicates directly with a database in which where all the 
                  St. Paul data resides. There are a total of three Get request paths created and a Delete and Post request 
                  created for the deletion and insertion of crime data. For the in class project the database was hosted locally
                  by using SQLLite Version 3. However, after the fact, I migrated the data into a PostgreSQL database hosted 
                  on CockroachDB Labs. The Restful API was also run locally for the project, but after the fact I launched it on
                  Vercel in which it speaks with the CockroachDB Database before sending the data to the client side page hosted on
                  the github repository. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Webpage itself was created using Vue.JS which is a Javascript framework for building user interfaces. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The completion of this project displays one's foundational understanding in the concepts of communication between 
                  databases, Restful APIs and Client Side User Interfaces. It also exemplifies the knowledge one has in the realm of 
                  web development in terms of implemented Promises, conditions, loops and the Model-View-Controller development concepts.

                  This project focused on developing a dynamic webserver with a team. My partners and I 
                  worked on a dynamic webserver implemented using Node.js that displays data and visualizations
                  relating to Energy consumption in the United States. The data was displayed by sector, by state, 
                  and by year.

                <p>
                  This project demonstrates an understanding in how on the server side how web pages can be generated 
                  based on the client's request. This understanding includes HTTP, HTTPS, CORS, HTTP response status codes
                  the browser and server communication methodologies, and much more.

                  Unlike the other projects in this portfolio this one is not currently live as there are some other 
                  features and bugs I want to work out of it first. However, by clicking the github logo below will bring 
                  you to the github repository where the code can be found. Your more than welcome to reach out any time

                  As someone that enjoys getting outdoors and photography, I found it 
                  cumbersum to be scowering the internet looking for campsites and places 
                  to go hike and walk in the state of Minnesota. Therefore as a personal project
                  I created a web tool in which plots out all Minnesota State Lands and an 
                  extensive collection of campgrounds in the state. This project will also 
                  have links to other trusted websites with free to use maps and resources to make 
                  planning one's next adventure in the land of 10,000 lakes so much easier.

                  Skilled in using <a class="content_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL"
                    target="_blank">WebGL</a>, I have demonstrated expertise in implementing lighting algorithms to
                  shade 3D objects and produce realistic lighting effects in computer graphics. My proficiency in
                  writing custom shaders using GLSL allowed me to pass the necessary information to the GPU for
                  processing, including vertex data, light source information, and material properties. During the
                  project, I focused on simulating real-world lighting, specifically multiple light sources, to
                  accurately depict the illumination of 3D objects.

                  3D shapes, including a rhombus and a yellow star, to showcase our ability to manipulate and display
                  objects in a 3D environment. We also implemented two of the most common lighting algorithms used in
                  online applications, <a class="content_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouraud_shading"

                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_shading" target="_blank">Phong shading</a>, to demonstrate
                  our understanding of these
                  techniques.

                <p>
                  Overall, my experience with WebGL and my ability to implement and understand the complexity
                  behind these realistic lighting and textures on 3D objects make me a suitable candidate
                  to consider in supporting any team working on similar projects.

                <h3>World Cinema Final Essay</h3>
                <p>
                  Throughout the semester in a course called World Cinema I was given the opportunity to watch films
                  made
                  throughout the last
                  few decades in many different countries including France, Japan, and Hong Kong. As a final
                  project for the class, I was
                  allowed to choose a country in which I would watch two films and compare them. I choose the country
                  China because of their
                  emphasis on martial arts films. One was titled <a class="content_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_(2002_film)" target="_blank"><i>Hero</i></a> and the other was titled <a class="content_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crouching_Tiger,_Hidden_Dragon" target="_blank"><i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i></a>. 
                  Throughout the essay I compared how beyond the martial arts these
                  films
                  emphasized different
                  cultural aspects that would have been seen in the time eras in which these films were placed (between
                  1046 BCE to 206 BCE).
                  Overall, my favorite part of this assignment was watching the films and seeing another culture's films
                  that I previously never knew about.

                  Interaction with Graphics is a multimedia installation that immerses the audience in the virtual realm
                  of computer
                  graphics through auditory, visual, and interactive queues. This time sequenced project, which is
                  entirely written
                  in Javascript with a library called <a class="content_link" href="https://threejs.org/"
                    target="_blank">ThreeJS</a>,
                  implements a variety
                  of abstract and
                  structured sequences, all of which demonstrate mathematical and programming achievements made in the
                  last 30 years,
                  such as perlin noise and sophisticated 3-dimensional model rendering. The main objective of this
                  endeavor is to
                  remind its audience of the past while demonstrating what the future holds.

                <h3>Computer Graphics - 3D Projections</h3>
                <p>
                  I have considerable experience in computer graphics and completed this project focused on drawing
                  3D lines onto a view plane using HTML's 2D Canvas API. My project involved implementing both parallel
                  and
                  perspective projections, as well as additional features such as animation and movement of 3D shapes
                  through the use of keyboard keys. I was able to create common 3D shapes such as cubes, cylinders,
                  cones and was close to completing a sphere. The end result was a custom scene that was precalculated
                  and uploaded through JSON to the project.
                  <br><br>
                  With this project, I have demonstrated my understanding of the display pipeline and the steps involved
                  in creating 3D graphics, including modeling, transformation, viewing, clipping, rasterization, and
                  display. I am confident in my ability to apply my skills to tackle new challenges in the field of
                  computer graphics.
